The breed is slow to mature, not reaching full size until at least three years of age. They are big cats, with males reaching as much as 17 pounds. Powerful and well balanced, the Shorthair is broad of chest and short of leg with rounded paws and a tail that narrows to a rounded tip from a thick base. Small ears top a sizeable head made to appear even wider thanks to the cat’s full cheeks.</span></p><p><img src="http://s1osmcysm.hn-bkt.clouddn.com/wiki-content-image/10/12/4b9b708f-e321-4e38-ae71-e8d66cd33dc2.jpg" alt="" title="" width="447" height="254" data-display="inline"></p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Colors</span></strong></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">The British Shorthair comes in many patterns and colors.

The ancestors of the British Shorthair were initially prized for their skill as hunters. Big and strong, they were more than a match for any rat or mouse, and thus earned their keep living in proximity to humans. Once a street cat, the British Shorthair is now highly prized as a companion and beloved for its beauty and engaging, loyal personality. The British Shorthair became an officially recognized breed in 1889, principally due to the work of enthusiast Harrison Weir. The first British Shorthair to earn a Grand Champion title under the rules of the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy was a blue male named Brynbuboo Little Monarch. Today, virtually all British Shorthairs trace their lineage back to this one cat.The British Shorthair is an adaptable and calm breed.</span></p><p><img src="http://s1osmcysm.hn-bkt.clouddn.com/wiki-content-image/10/8/a992dcd6-185a-4a29-ae69-0561ed00abd2.jpg" alt="" title="" width="459" height="263" data-display="inline"></p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">BreedTraits</span></strong></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">The British Shorthair is an adaptable and calm breed. They learn quickly, and get along well with all members of the household, although they do tend to bond more deeply with the human of their choice. They don’t like to be carried, but other than that the British Shorthair is an easy going cat that doesn’t have much to say. Somewhat rowdy as kittens, they grow out of their boisterous phase to become excellent companions and members of the family. The British Shorthair is not especially vocal, nor are they bad to wander away. They can be left alone without suffering from either separation anxiety or loneliness.</span></p><p><img src="http://s1osmcysm.hn-bkt.clouddn.com/wiki-content-image/11/12/b8f16391-88fb-4bdf-86fd-9b93e34dba30.jpg" alt="" title="" width="446" height="243" data-display="inline"></p><h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">OverallDescription</span></strong></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(124, 124, 124);">Often described as having a “teddy bear” appearance, the British Shorthair is a sturdy cat with a large head and big, round, inquisitive eyes.
