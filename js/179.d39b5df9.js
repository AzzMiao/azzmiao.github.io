The ancestors of the British Shorthair were initially prized for their skill as hunters. Big and strong, they were more than a match for any rat or mouse, and thus earned their keep living in proximity to humans. Once a street cat, the British Shorthair is now highly prized as a companion and beloved for its beauty and engaging, loyal personality. The British Shorthair became an officially recognized breed in 1889, principally due to the work of enthusiast Harrison Weir.
